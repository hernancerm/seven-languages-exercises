# Io. Day 2: The Sausage King

## Do

### Do 1

<table><tr><td>
A Fibonacci sequence starts with two 1s. Each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers that
came before: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. Write a program to find the nth Fibonacci number.
fib(1) is 1, and fib(4) is 3. As a bonus, solve the problem with recursion and with loops.

### Do 2

<table><tr><td>
How would you change / to return 0 if the denominator is zero?
</table></tr></td>

### Do 3

<table><tr><td>
Write a program to add up all of the numbers in a two-dimensional array.
</table></tr></td>

### Do 4

<table><tr><td>
Add a slot called myAverage to a list that computes the average of all the numbers in a list. What
happens if there are no numbers in a list? (Bonus: Raise an Io exception if any item in the list is
not a number.)
</table></tr></td>

[do4.io](./do4.io)

### Do 5

<table><tr><td>
Write a prototype for a two-dimensional list. The dim(x, y) method should allocate a list of y lists
that are x elements long. set(x, y, value) should set a value, and get(x, y) should return that
value.
</table></tr></td>

### Do 6

<table><tr><td>
Bonus: Write a transpose method so that (new_matrix get(y, x)) == matrix get(x, y) on the original
list.
</table></tr></td>

### Do 7

<table><tr><td>
Write the matrix to a file, and read a matrix from a file.
</table></tr></td>

### Do 8

<table><tr><td>
Write a program that gives you ten tries to guess a random number from 1--100. If you would like,
